/*  Sum of Beauty of All Substrings

Given a string s, return the sum of the beauty of all substrings of s. 
The beauty of a substring is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies of the characters present in that substring.

Examples:

Input: s = "aaac"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are "aaac" and "aac". 
For "aaac", the frequencies are a = 3 and c = 1. Its beauty is 3 − 1 = 2. 
For "aac", the frequencies are a = 2 and c = 1. Its beauty is 2 − 1 = 1. 
The remaining substrings have a beauty of 0. Therefore, the sum of the beauties of all substrings is 2 + 1 = 3.
Input: s = "aabc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are "aab" and "aabc". 
For "aab", the frequencies are a = 2 and b = 1. Its beauty is 2 − 1 = 1. 
For "aabc", the frequencies are a = 2, b = 1, and c = 1. Its beauty is 2 − 1 = 1. 
Therefore, the sum of the beauties of all substrings is 1 + 1 = 2.
Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 500
s consists only of lowercase English alphabets  */
