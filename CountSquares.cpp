/*  Count Squares
Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space of perfect squares. 
The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …)
 
Examples :
Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2. 
Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the only Perfect Square less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 108  */

class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int n) {
        // code here
        return sqrt(n-1);
    }
};
